# CalvinHigdon's **Nvim** Configurations

As one may have guessed by now, this repository's purpose is to keep track of all of my **Nvim** configurations, including all of the plugins that I use with **Nvim**, and their corresponding configuration files.
I will only update this repository when I have completely resolved any issues with any series of changes.
